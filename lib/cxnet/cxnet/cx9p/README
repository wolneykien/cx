This branch descends from `9p' branch. Additional files are some 9P code and manual accompained with the generator files. The generator is used to output the up-to-date version of the messages.py file on the base of the 9P files and manual pages.

To regenerate the files do the following steps

# Check out this branch
$ git checkout templates

# Skip the modifications with previously generated material
$ git merge -s ours -m "Pre-sync the templates" <9P-UPDATE-COMMIT>

# Include the modifications to the template part of messages.py if any
$ git merge 9p -m "Sync the templates" 9p

# Re-generate the messages.py written to messages.py.out
$ make

# Check out the 9p branch
$ git checkout 9p

# Update the messages.py file
$ mv messages.py.out messages.py

# Commit the modifications of the generated material
$ git add messages.py
$ git commit -m <a comment>

That last commit to the 9p branch should be skipped next time with git merge -s ours ... (step 1).
