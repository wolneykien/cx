"""
The module for parsing a memory block constructing a list of pair
objects. Each pair consists of a static head of predetermined length
and stricture called a *car* and some tail, called a *cdr*, the length
and structure of which are known only in runtime. The cdr, if it is
defined, is always a pair itself.

1. Parsing in general
=====================

A memory block is always parsed consequently, from the start to the
end. The first *n* bytes of the block are accessd as the static head
of the first pair *p* via ``p.car()`` method.  The reset of the block
is supposed to be the next pair which can be potentially get via
``p.cdr()`` method. The length of that second pair is not defined save
for its static head, i.e. ``p.cdr().car()``: to define its class
(and therefore the structure) the ``p.car().cdarclass()`` method is
consulted. With the use of ``cdarclass()`` method the structure of the
next pair is determined in runtime on the base of values in the static
head of the previous pair. In particular case there could be no next
pair. In that case, the ``cdarclass()`` method should return
``type(None)``.

2. Parsing arrays
=================

In some cases, a car should not be responsible for the rest of the
block. That is a natural case for an element of an array: it may know
nothing of the next element because the array's head is responsible
for all of its elements. To implement that concept the «responsibility
handover» mechanism can be unilized. If an object is not responsible
for the class of the next pair's car the ``cdarclass()`` method simply
should not be defined. In that case the system tries same method in
the parent object with calculated index value as an argument. If it
isn't defined in the parent, the parent's parent object is tried, if
exists, and so on. The parent pointer and the index value are
related objects: the parent of a pair is the pair that defines class
of its car in a course of the described procedure while the index
value is incremented for each defined pair starting with 0.

3. Exceptions
=============

* If the length of the static head of a pair (car) exceeds the length
  of the memory block being parsed an ``OverflowError`` is raised.

* If the current set of values in the car object doesn't define a
  proper state and the class of the next pair's car can not be
  determined the ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError`` should be raised
  in the ``cdarclass()`` method.

* If the index value passed to the ``cdarclass()`` method exceeds
  some limit then the ``IndexError`` should be raised. In that case,
  as when no ``cdarclass()`` method is defined for a car object at all,
  the call is transferred to the parent object.
